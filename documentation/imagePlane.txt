/*
TO DO:
- Move lowerResRebinAdditive and lowerResRebinIntegrate to RectGrid because they are about manipulating grids
- Clarify the role of maskData

TO CONSIDER:
- Move Crosses to Pert?
- move InterpolationCells to RectGrid? Or connect them somehow.
*/



This class is designed to represent an observed image.
Each instance is uniquely defined by a filename (setting grid.z), B, S, and C.
The ImagePlane object has a lot of functionality covered by the RectGrid class.
For quick reference and backward compatibility I kept Ni,Nj,Nm.
Of specific relevence to an ImagePlane object are the:
- defl_x,defl_y: stored pre-computed deflection angles, in conjustion with a specific mass model.
- active: the pixels inside the mask (value of 1)
- InterpolationCells: not sure if this can be covered by RectGrid
- crosses: this is considered only in conjuction with a Pert mass model.
- B: blurring matrix (PSF)
- C: covariance matrix (for the noise)
- S: mask
- noise_flag: correlated,uniform,noise map




Constructors:
- One to read in existing images
- One to create empty images, but with all coordinates set
- Copy constructor is to create new ImagePlanes that have matching dimensions but are empty.

Member functions:
- writeImage: writes the RectGrid with header entries specific to the ImagePlane object
- readB/readC/readS: read the corresponding matrices
- printCross: prints the cross structure k, maybe more pertinent to the Pert class
- setCroppedLimitsEven: used to crop the PSF
- setCroppedLimitsOdd: used to crop the PSF

- maskData:
