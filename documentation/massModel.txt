This class represents any lensing potential as a collection of individual lens mass models and an omni-present deflection potential due to external shear.


BASE MASS MODEL

Constructors: None

Member functions (non-virtual):
- setMassPars:
- printMassPars:

Member functions (virtual):
- psi: calculates the lensing potential
- defl: calculates the deflection angles (first derivatives of the potential)
- kappa: calculates the convergence (second derivatives of psi)
- gamma: calculates the shear magnitude and direction (second derivatives of psi)




PERT

This implements a perturbing field that is represented by a FixedSource, i.e. a rectangular grid (RectGrid) complemented with a regularization scheme.

Constructors:
- Create an abstract Pert object
- Create a Pert object based on an ImagePlane
- Read in a Pert object from a file. This is the only constructor that actually initializes the dpsi and its derivatives.

Member functions (virtual):
- defl: calculates the deflection angles which are the derivatives of the dpsi field, hence, it just interpolates the zx and zy of the grid.
- psi: calculates the values of the dpsi field by interpolation the grid.
- kappa: calculates kappa based on the second derivatives of the grid.
- gamma: calculates gamma_mag and gamma_phi based on the second derivatives and the mixed derivative of the grid.

Member functions (non-virtual):
- replaceDpsi: replaces the values of dpsi (z of the grid) with the given ones, and calls updatePert.
- addDpsi: adds the given Ddpsi values to the existing dpsi (z of the grid), and calls updatePert.
- updatePert: updates all the derivatives.
